title: Gosset's 4_21 Polytope
description: An adaptation of Scott's implementation of the Gosset's 4_21 polytope. Both the elimination of overlapping struts and the replacement of crossing struts by intersecting half-blue struts has been performed programmatically. No attempt has been made to build this monster.

<a href="https://vorth.github.io/vzome-sharing/2005/09/18/gossets-polytopes.html?id=gossets-polytopes">Scott</a> made a vZome model of the Gosset's 4_21 polytope<a href="https://joris1724.github.io/vzome-sharing/2025/03/19/15-47-22-Gosset's-3_21-Polytope/">.</a> 

A first perl script cleaned up his model a bit by eliminating all (partially) overlapping struts, reducing the number of struts from 2752 to 1336.

As too many sets of crossing struts had to be replaced by intersecting struts, A second perl script performed the job. All calculations are entirely done in the golden field. Off the resulting 7628 struts, 3480 are half-blue.
