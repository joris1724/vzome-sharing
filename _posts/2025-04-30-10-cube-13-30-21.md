<a href="https://vorth.github.io/vzome-sharing/2024/04/18/07-15-12-10-cube-centered/">Scott</a> made a vZome model of the Icosahedral projection of the 10-cube. After removal of all overlapping struts, and replacement of all crossing struts by intersecting struts, it appears that a physical model would require 3333 balls and 12220 struts (120 y00, 1680 y0, 3980 y1, 4840 y2, 1340 y3 and 260 y4). In his excellent recent publication about <a href="">regular polytopes beyond the fourth dimension</a> Paulo Freire is absolutely right  stating: <i>this projection is so complex that it is impractical to make a physical model of it with Zometool<i>. He also remarks that <i>its envelope is a Rhombic enneacontahedron, the largest Zometoolable yellow zonohedron</i>. In the present model, this envelope is <i>painted black</i>.
