As building a complete Zometool model of the 10-cube is beyond reach, I made a model keeping only about an eighth of the original struts. Then I connected the vertices at an equal distance from the centre with blue struts, revealing seven non-intersecting polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry: a rhombicosadodecahedron (black vertices), an icosadodecahedron (grey vertices), a larger rhombicosadodecahedron (purple vertices), a buckyball truncated icosahedron (blue vertices), a Zometool connector truncated icosadodecahedro (teal vertices), another truncated icosahedron (teallite vertices) and another truncated icosadodecahedron (white vertices). This results in a very beautifull Zometool model, not the easiest to build though. It definitely needs a pedestal, such as the one displayed in the last scene of the vZome model with building instructions.
