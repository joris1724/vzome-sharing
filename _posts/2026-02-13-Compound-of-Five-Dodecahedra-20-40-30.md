title: Compound of Five Dodecahedra
description: A compound constructed by rotating five copies of a dodecahedron by 0°, 72°, 144°, 216° and 288° respectively, around an axis through the centre of the dodecahedron. For one specific choice of this axis, the compound has icosahedral symmetry.

To obtain icosahedral symmetry, the rotation axis must be taken through a point on the extention of an edge, at 1/(2&phi;) of the edge length.
<p>
The vZome model of the skeleton and support structure of this compound is rather exotic: besides red, blue and yellow Zometool struts, it has edges belonging to the apple, black, lavender, navy, olive, purple, rose, sulfur and turquoise vZome orbits:

The b1, b2, y2, y3 and r3 struts are standard Zometool struts. All others had to be <a href="https://joris1724.github.io/vzome-sharing/2026/02/13/20-40-30-Compound-of-Five-Dodecahedra/Compound-of-Five-Dodecahedra-Struts.zip">designed (vZome and OpenSCAD)</a> and 3D printed. To avoid interference with other struts, one of the feet of the larger olive struts are redirected to a rectangular hole.
<p>
In the skeleton of this compound, it is hard to identify the five components. Therefore, three types of panels have been <a href="https://joris1724.github.io/vzome-sharing/2026/02/13/20-40-30-Compound-of-Five-Dodecahedra/Compound-of-Five-Dodecahedra-Panels.scad">designed</a>, and 3D printed using PLA in five colors. One of the types actually is composed out of two neighbouring panels of the same colour, integrating the common edge belonging to the black vZome orbit. The three types of panels clearly emphasize the icosahedral two-, three- and five-fold symmetry axes of the compound.

To conclude a picture taken just before finishing the model, clearly showing the internal support structure. Without it, the model would be too flimsy during construction. Once paneled, the model is very rigid.
