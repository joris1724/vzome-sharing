This polytope is also called the first stellation of the hecatonicosachoron<a href="https://joris1724.github.io/vzome-sharing/2025/02/09/11-12-57-Small-Stellated-Hecatonicosachoron/">.</a> It is the 4D analog of the small stellated dodecahedron, which is the first stellation of the dodecahedron in 3D. Both are constructed by simply extending the edges (<a href="https://www.nan.ma/star/#/polytope_52_5_3">Nan Ma</a>). As all star polytopes, it has full hexacosichoric symmetry. The only face type present is a regular pentagram. Various undistorted polyhedra are visible in the model: icosahedra, great icosahedra, compounds of five cubes, a dodecadodecahedron, two concentric superposed great stellated dodecahedra, .... It also has a model of the hecatonicosachoron embedded in it.
<p>
<a href="https://polytopologist.github.io/zome_pages/stellated120cell01.htm">David Richter</a> already described how to make a Zometool model.
<p>
In the present vZome model, each teal ball connects two hb1 and two hb2 struts. Replacing these by a b2 bending over a b1 without connector, puts too much strain on these struts and the neighbouring connectors. If one would build the model at a &phi; larger scale, bending a b3 over a b2 is acceptable.
