One of the most frustrating models <a href="https://georgehart.com/zomebook/ten-prisms.html">George Hart</a> ever made<a href="https://joris1724.github.io/vzome-sharing/2025/02/15/12-54-33-Compound-of-10-Triangular-Prisms/">.</a>
<p>
Firstly, build a truncated dodecahedron with edge length b1.
<p>
Next build ten extended prisms, one at a time. An extended prism consist of triangular prism with triangular base (edge length b1) and side edge length y1+y1+y3+y1+y1. Each extended prism will be squeezed in between two triangular faces of the truncated dodecahedron, so that the whole structure stays together during buildup, and one has both hands free to insert new elements. When introducing an new extended prism, I advice to rotate the truncated dodecahedron so that the first base is at the bottom, and the edges are introduced vertically. For the vZome model, the truncated dodecahedron should be rotated in sync so that the first base of a new extended prism is at the back, and the edges point to the viewpoint. Doing so, it is easier to correctly weave new edges in between existing ones. The more prisms are already present, the more attention is needed to this. No dexterity is needed. It helped me a lot to use coloured Zome balls, precisely as in the vZome model.
<p>
Next, remove the truncated dodecahedron. Probably the truncated dodecahedron will be broken at some point(s), due to increasing tension, after insertion of the penultimate and last extended prisms. No worries, by then the structure is stable enough by itself. Finally, remove the bases and y1 struts of the extended prisms
<p>
The model must be build at this scale. Even now, citing George, there is a slight amount of free play that allows the prisms to slide loosely in and out. George was right: it is very satisfying when you finally complete the model. It took me more than 20 years after my first attempt. Without the vZome model, I would not have retried and succeeded.
