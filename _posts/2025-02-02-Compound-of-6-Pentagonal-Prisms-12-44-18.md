Another "even trickier" model <a href="https://georgehart.com/zomebook/compounds.html">George Hart</a> proposed in 2001. The more prisms are already present, the more attention is needed to correctly weave new edges in between existing ones.
<p>
Firstly, build a regular dodecahedron with edge length b3.
<p>
Next build six extended prisms, one at a time. An extended prism consist of pentagonal prism with pentagonal base (edge length b3) and side edge length r0+r0+r0+r3+r0+r0+r0. Each extended prism will be squeezed around two faces of the dodecahedron, so that the whole structure stays together during buildup, and one has both hands free to insert new elements. When introducing an new extended prism, I advice to rotate the dodecahedron so that the first base is at the bottom, and the edges are introduced vertically. For the vZome model, the dodecahedron should be rotated in sync so that the first base of a new extended prism is at the back, and the edges point to the viewpoint. Doing so, it is easier to correctly weave new edges in between existing ones. The more prisms are already present, the more attention is needed to this. No dexterity is needed though. It helped me a lot to use coloured Zome balls, precisely as in the vZome model.
<p>
Finally, remove the dodecahedron. and the bases and r0 struts of the extended prisms
<p>
Citing George, it is very amazing how no two blue struts quite touch: the only contact between different prisms is where a blue strut touches a red strut near its center. This will not happen unless the model is build at this scale.
